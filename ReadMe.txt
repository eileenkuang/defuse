The Alpha Program is not a fully complete program.


After starting up the program, press the Play button. Then, press on either KeyQuest Odyssey, CryptoCipher, or Rhythmic Recall (those are the ones that have been worked on).


KeyQuest Odyssey has a “quit” button that can be used to return to the main menu, but the other games do not and the game will have to be restarted to go back to the main menu.
